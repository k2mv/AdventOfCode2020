# 25

I lost about 20 minutes because 1) distracted by helping with cooking and 2) I didn't catch that I wrote `value * subject` instead of `value *= subject` and ended up locking myself in an infinite loop for no reason.

**Part 1** and **Part 2** may look kind of similar; try the problem yourself to see why.

Thanks and Merry Christmas, Eric!  &#x1F389;  See you next year.
