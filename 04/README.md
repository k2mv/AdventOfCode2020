Good grief.  I don't know how Python works.

* I started using shorter filenames so I could work with them easier.
* I lost a lot of time on botched pastes.  Think before you paste.  And think after you paste, so you don't leave old code in that you were supposed to change.
* Note to self: use a longer name for the file input next time, because you will end up wanting to use 'f' as a variable name and that will cause you even more unnecessary grief.
