This felt like it went quickly, though I'm pretty sure that's because I wrote all my planning out in the comments and on my paper notepad before coding anything.  It wasn't so much a fast solution as it was a solution that I only had to code once because I took my time.

Properly tracking position and adjacency in vertical/horizontal coordinates in a hex grid could get messy - but if you change what the coordinates mean, you can turn the problem into something relatively straightforward to calculate.
