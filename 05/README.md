This would go a lot faster if I had caffeine at midnight, but I'm not going to take a hit of caffeine at midnight just to shave 10 minutes off my solve time.  Bite me, self.

* I did a lot of scaffolding (`a_list`, `a_dict`) just in case I needed some of these data structures - only needed one of them.
* Once I figured out the straight binary coding of the input, it was just a matter of making a for loop index line up with the math - which turned out to be hard when I broke my brain trying to remember Python for loops _and_ ranges _and_ just how long those strings were anyway, at the same time.  That's why I brute forced the loop index.
* Part 2: It turns out you can ignore the warning about the very front and very back seats if you just... scroll up and look for the answer wedged squarely between the wall of low numbers and wall of high numbers.  Good enough!
