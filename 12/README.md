Wow!  &#x1F625;  After a rough day 10-11 I finally managed to snag both stars in under an hour.

Never really ground to a halt progress-wise like the past two days; just wrote with reusability and adaptability in mind (which slowed me down for **Part 1** but saved my bacon when it became quite easy to convert existing functions into new ones for **Part 2**).

* Finally getting the hang of chunking the major moving parts out into separate functions.  (I know this is straight out of Programming 101, but we have to start training our instincts somewhere.)
* I couldn't recall a simple mathematical way to turn degrees into right angle rotations, so I just modeled the standard mathematical conventions (X comma Y; positive rotation is counter-clockwise) and hard coded everything.
