# 10

**Part 1** was a breeze.

**Part 2** was a 19 hour journey through the wilderness.  (I finally got a clean and simple answer, though.)

You'll find a running journal in the scratchpad section of Day 2.

Lessons learned:
* Don't stay up more than like 90 minutes past midnight if it's just not happening.
* Try first to separate what changes from what doesn't
* And then try to separate what matters to the answer from what doesn't.
* And see if you can reduce the data to something that doesn't require *exploding memory usage*.
