# 11

Figuring out what to do was relatively simple; writing it out correctly with all edge cases (&#x1F60F;) properly handled took time.

I'm sure there are far less complicated ways to do this.  I can see ways to break out most of the repetitive parts of `process2()` into a new function, for example.

* Probably should start detouring into actually writing new functions when I see that happening next time.  Debugging sloppily updated pasted blocks of code is a bear &#x1F43B; when it gets this complicated.
