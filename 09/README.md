Part 1 was straightforward.

I read the prompt for Part 2 wrong (thinking that it was the sum of the first and and last values (line number wise) in the range adding up to the target number, and not the sum of the *smallest and largest* numbers in that range.

As a result, I ended up reaching the same (incorrect) answer several times, causing me to attempt to brute force the answer using the (correctly identified) range length and starting index, getting the same incorrect answer several times, before reading the prompt one more time and cursing myself out.

Learn from my suffering.
