# 15

Well, that was different.

I ended up letting my code from **Part 1** run while I ate dinner in order to solve **Part 2**.

I am certain there is some kind of mechanic that can be used to solve it more quickly; I'll keep looking for it, and update this folder later.

UPDATE: There is a simple mechanic that can be used (`15_fixed.py`) to solve it in about 10 seconds.  It's called "remember to take out the print statements before running".  Good to know!
