Ok here's the deal - I eyeballed the input list and saw that there weren't very many low numbers.  So I made a lazy assumption that ended up working fine with the limited data set.

Since the high numbers were mostly in the high 1000s, I figured I could just make a separate list of small numbers and find all the ways those numbers combined, and run that against the high numbers as a 2-number match like in part 1.
