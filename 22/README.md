# 22

Okay!  **Part 1** was pretty straightforward, but for **Part 2** I had to sketch out the flow of the game rules before I felt comfortable putting anything down on screen.

The recursive game with the full puzzle input takes many thousands of rounds (possibly millions, but an actual count would be outside the scope of tonight's code).  I was starting to suspect I had written bad code that was falling into infinite loops, but I took all my print statements out *(thanks, Day 15!)* and found that it finishes in less time than it takes to go get a glass of water.
