# 07

Slow and steady, fully recursive.
* Botched a single indent, (`a_dict[bag_primary] = bag_ref`), causing some bag types to not have dictionary entries initially.  Indents are your friend!
* Ignore `bag_dive`, that was a first crack at recursion that I abandoned.
* This is the first day in AoC that I actually called a function that I wrote.  Progress!
