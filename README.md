"Solutions" for exercises on https://adventofcode.com/

If the code is here, then it got me the correct answer somehow.

* I don't know Python.
* I'm going for quick and dirty answers more than clever answers (though I'd like to have both if possible).
* This is the state of the text editor at the moment I cleared each step.  There will be a lot of unused junk code.
* I may or may not have run the program multiple times with different variables instead of putting it in a function.
